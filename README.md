# Project Name

# Description
This website recommends restaurants to users based on their preference priority.

# Strength
Users could get different recommendations based on their different preference ranking of each time.There are 8 candidates for prioritizing, such as tasty, environment, price below 30, parking, etc. Our specific alogrithm will get the best recommendation result from the order of these candidates and then push it to users.

# Weakness
The whole website is not yet complete. Because of the class team work, time is limited, so we only implemented some important features.
