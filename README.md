# Feedback
- feedback1 folder
  - Consider having something like Pandora music app setting where you denote what are your favorite restaurants and it takes that into account. 
- feedback3 folder
  - Make sure you erase comments that are for internal purposes like names of people who worked on different code. 
  - careful about how you name the files,
  - Why are so many attributes required in the model? Organization of files makes them difficult to find, why not send your js files to their own folder.
  - All files in one directory, needs to be broken out into separate directories. e.g. routes. models, etc.
